Bonus Points Claimed: +5 for .git
Comments: I probably spent more time working on this than you intended but I had to refresh myself on Java syntax.
This week was a lot of slow-going and review since it's been a minute since I took the first course.
I thought this assignment was helpful and I like using IntelliJ and Git.
